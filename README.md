# Evaluation_TEI-XML
## Description of the choosen materiel
For the evaluation of the XML course, I choose three poems of the Breton poetess Anjela Duval, from one of her notebook : *Bisigou Haleg*, *Erch Mezheven* and *Al Alc'houez Aour*.
Born in 1905, she's a farmer who writes poems about her daily life and an activist for ecology and the preservation of the Breton language.
All of her poetry, writted on different notebooks and scattered sheets, is digitized and accessible on the digital library of Rennes 2 University : https://bibnum.univ-rennes2.fr/items/show/513

I choose these poems because they were handwritted and I wanted to try doing a transcription.
It also was the occasion to practice reusing datasets, specifically those related to Brittany and to practice structuring in XML through the poetic form (stanzas, verses, etc.).

## Reflexion on the use of XML
I thought that it was interesting to work on XML with texts written in a regional language, in order to explore their possibilities of preservation and valorization.
I used a inspired TEI structure for the header, but the global structure is a basic XML. 
I would like to develop TEI better because it's a standard and international language and it provides an ideal framework for connecting local heritage (in this case, Breton poetry) to a more global form of transmission and comprehension. 

## AI declaration
I used AI for brainstorming ideas and to clarify some XML principles, particularly to better understand which elements to include in the header attributes when I didnâ€™t fully understand the TEI guidelines.
